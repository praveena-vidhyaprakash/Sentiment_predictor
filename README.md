# Sentiment Predictor

A Python-based machine learning application that predicts the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of text inputs.

## Features
- Classifies sentiment using a trained model.
- Simple and beginner-friendly interface (CLI or optional web UI).
- Includes data handling and a pre-trained model for easy use.
